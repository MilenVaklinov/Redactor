{"name":"Redactor","tagline":"","body":"**Redactor** is a micro _Emacs_ text editor that runs on Unix-like operating systems originally written by Milen Vaklinov using C++ and Qt Framework. Redactor is open source and freely distributed.\r\n\r\n![Redactor](http://i.imgur.com/BzykeLS.png)\r\n\r\nRedactor allows several files to be edited at the same time. The screen can be split into different windows and screens, and text may be moved freely from one window on any screen to the next. Depending on the type of file being edited, Redactor can change how it behaves to make editing simple. Editing standard text files, program files and word processing documents are all possible at the same time.\r\n\r\n![Splitter](http://i.imgur.com/i2mGiSO.png)\r\n\r\nDired makes an Redactor buffer containing a listing of a directory, and optionally some of its subdirectories as well. You can use the normal Redactor commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired commands to operate on the listed files.\r\n\r\n![Dired](http://i.imgur.com/Cqil10K.png)\r\n\r\nThere are extensive capabilities to make word processing and editing easier. These include commands for string searching and replacing, paragraph reformatting and deleting, automatic word wrapping, word move and deletes, easy case controlling, and automatic word counts.\r\n\r\n## Other tools\r\n\r\n**Shell**\r\n\r\n![Shell](http://i.imgur.com/86jWFYg.png)\r\n\r\n**Source Counter**\r\n\r\n![Source Counter](http://i.imgur.com/FCgN7NB.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
