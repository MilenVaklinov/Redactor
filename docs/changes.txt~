<x-bg-color><param>sandybrown</param><x-color><param>black</param>THings to fix:

- *Buffer List* is too small when call it

- splitting after using M-x append-to-buffer

- C-x C-c after 'Esc Esc Esc' or 'C-g' doesn't work -> Reason: because we don't enter value.

I created a new variable: in_exit_mode and it works but I should do it with keyPressEvent to catch

every key.

- C-M-s and C-M-r commands need a change as 'C-s' and 'C-r' commands</x-color></x-bg-color>

or when I press M-x not to update_minibuffer() and the function

update_minibuffer() not to clear the selections

<x-bg-color><param>darkseagreen2</param>zix 83</x-bg-color>
