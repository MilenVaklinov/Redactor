1. A file with unique name to be open only on one place.

2. After the commands C-x 1 and "v" in *Buffer List*, the pressing of Enter doesn't work.

3. There is no focus when we press C-x n and C-x p after the command "v".

xxx 4. When we switch to buffer using C-x 4 b command and split this window several 
times, C-x { and C-x } do not work. Check Carefully! *** Done ***

5. This is not a bug, just better solution. I found that it is better solution to use 
   {
        QEventLoop loop;
        loop.connect(minibuffer, SIGNAL(returnPressed()), &loop, SLOT(quit()));
        loop.exec();
   }
And to put the output in a string using set_string. After that we can use the result
in the same function and to continue instead of using two functions, one for mode and one
for the actual action.
